// -- Whether that length is certain enough to fade on --------------------------

// `getDuration()` cannot corroborate the bar, because during a gapless append it
// is wrong in both directions and the fade sits in the worst of them. Measured
// live across one advance: the bar held 289 for the whole track while
// getDuration climbed 289.0, 290.6, 296.7, 304.9 as the next track appended, and
// on the track after it read 29.9, 49.9, 59.9, 79.8 against a steady bar of 134.
// A symmetric tolerance refuses both, and a one-sided one still refuses the tail,
// which is precisely where a fade is armed and waiting.
// What separates the one case this guard exists for is not size but movement.
// The bar still timing an ad the attribute has released reads its total as the
// ad's and then changes it when the real track starts, measured as 0:13, 0:14,
// 0:46, then 3:57. A bar describing the track it is on does not move. So the
// question is whether the bar's own total has settled, and the player's clock is
// not consulted at all.
